# okf diff

Concept-level diff of the working tree against a git ref: which concepts were added, removed, or changed.

## Arguments

| Argument | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `<git_ref>` | positional | yes | Git ref to diff against (e.g. `HEAD`, a branch, or a commit) |
| `<bundle>` | positional | no | Bundle directory (explicit, then $OKF_BUNDLE, nearest okf.toml, or current directory) |
| `--fail-on <value>` | string | no | Fail (exit 1) on any change: never (default) | info | warn | error | any (default: `never`) |

Global `--json` requests NDJSON. The optional trailing `bundle` positional is a path; `--bundle-id` selects a catalog identity. Selection uses explicit path or ID, `$OKF_BUNDLE` (path), registered containing bundle, configured default, sole catalog entry, then uncataloged cwd. Selection and examination scope are separate.

Output stream: `diff`.
