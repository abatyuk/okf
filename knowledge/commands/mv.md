# okf mv

Moves or renames a concept and rewrites body links, ontology references, and standard internal `sources[].resource` paths. It also rebases the moved concept's relative standard paths. Repository-relative `git-path` and `git-commit` source resources remain unchanged.

## Arguments

| Argument | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `<old>` | positional | yes | Existing concept id |
| `<new>` | positional | yes | New concept id |
| `<bundle>` | positional | no | Bundle directory (explicit, then $OKF_BUNDLE, nearest okf.toml, or current directory) |

Global `--json` requests NDJSON. The optional trailing `bundle` positional resolves as explicit argument, `$OKF_BUNDLE`, nearest `okf.toml`, then cwd.

Output stream: `change`.
